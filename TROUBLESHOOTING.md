# White Page Troubleshooting (GitHub Pages)

If you see a white page after deploying, it is almost always due to incorrect path configuration. Here is how to fix it:

### 1. Check the Browser Console
Right-click your white page, select **Inspect**, and go to the **Console** tab.
- If you see errors like `GET .../assets/index-XXXX.js 404 (Not Found)`, your **Base Path** is wrong.

### 2. The Fix: Relative Paths
I have updated `vite.config.ts` to use `base: './'`. This makes the app use **relative paths**, which is the most compatible setting for GitHub Pages.

**Action Required:**
1. Open `vite.config.ts`.
2. Ensure it looks like this:
   ```typescript
   base: './',
   ```
3. Re-run the deployment:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

### 3. Ensure `.nojekyll` exists
GitHub Pages uses a system called Jekyll that can sometimes block files generated by Vite.
- I have added a step to create a `.nojekyll` file in your `dist` folder during deployment.

### 4. Direct Upload vs. `npm run deploy`
- **Do NOT** manually upload the `dist` folder to your GitHub repository's `main` branch.
- **DO** use `npm run deploy`. This command creates a special `gh-pages` branch that GitHub uses to serve your site.

## Updated Deployment Steps

1. **Update `package.json`**:
   Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your actual info.
2. **Build and Deploy**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```
3. **Verify Settings on GitHub**:
   - Go to your repo > **Settings** > **Pages**.
   - Ensure **Branch** is set to `gh-pages`.
   - The URL should look like `https://username.github.io/repo-name/`.
